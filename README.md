## Description

This project is an e-commerce site's back end that utilizes the latest technologies. It is built using Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. By completing this challenge, I gained practical experience with key web development technologies such as Express.js, Sequelize, MySQL, and API routes.

Completing the E-commerce Back End challenge has been a great experience for me as a web developer. It has not only helped me build a functional e-commerce back end, but it has also provided me with practical experience in working with both front-end and back-end technologies. Through this project, I have been able to develop my problem-solving skills, gain experience in handling database connectivity, and routing. Overall, this project has been a significant step forward in my development as a web developer, and it has prepared me for future web development challenges.
